  Class:
 A class is a template/Blueprint to create an object. an object can not be created without a class

  What is the syntax for class?
 We start with the class key word, then we write the name of the class, start curly braces and end curly braces

 public class Car {

 Inside a class we can have
 variables (Attributes of the class)
 Methods (Behavior of the class) Methods are verbs, they do something
 etc.....right now the focus is non variables and methods
 }

 1. we define attributes using variable e.g color, size, models
 2. we define behavior using methods.g make calls, listen to music, text, download


 For e.g the phone class i can create Objects and objects can be as many as possible.
 To create object we use the key word "new"

        what is an Object?
 Everything around us is an object for example keyboard, mouse,
 glass, etc.
 An Object in programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.
 Object is a basic unit of object oriented programming and represents the real life entities inside of the computer

 Objects have states that defines how the object looks like. we define the states of aan object inside a class with the help of Attributes/properties/fields inside a class.
 Objects can also have behaviours(Things that object can do). We use methods to define these behaviors.


           Object oriented programming:
 Is just a way of writing programs.
 Why we should learn OOP?
 1)It simplify the development of large programs.
 2)It will also help us maintain and modify the existing code.
 3)It helps use write more secure code
 4)It helps us avoid duplicate code.

             Main pillars of OOP
 1)Classes and objects.
 2)Inheritance.
 3)Polymorphism.
 4)Abstraction.
 5)Encapsulation.
